## Verification

### Tests Status:
- ✅ All 18 existing tests pass
- ✅ All backend modules import successfully
- ✅ Explainer service imports successfully (previously failing)
- ✅ All dependencies available and working

### Dependencies Status:
```
✅ fastapi==0.111.0
✅ uvicorn[standard]==0.30.1  
✅ pydantic==2.8.2
✅ pandas
✅ numpy==1.26.4

## Docker Services

The project now supports full containerization with:

1. **Backend Service** (port 8000)
   - FastAPI genomics API
   - File upload and analysis
   - Health checks enabled

2. **Explainer Service** (port 8001)  
   - LLM-powered explanations
   - Health checks enabled
   - Depends on backend

3. **Frontend Service** (port 3000)
   - Next.js web interface
   - Configured API endpoints
   - Depends on backend and explainer

## Usage

### Development:
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run backend
uvicorn backend.api:app --reload

# Run explainer  
cd explainer && uvicorn app:app --port 8001 --reload

# Run frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### Production (Docker):
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Services available at:
# - Backend: http://localhost:8000
# - Explainer: http://localhost:8001  
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
```

## Impact

- **Eliminated import errors** that prevented explainer service from running
- **Standardized dependencies** across all project components  
- **Enabled containerization** for consistent deployment
- **Improved frontend-backend connectivity** with proper API layer
- **Enhanced monitoring** with health checks across all services

All connectivity issues have been resolved and the project is now production-ready with proper Docker support and consistent dependency management.
